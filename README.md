# FOLIO_LICENSES
Script to create licenses json 
FOLIO service module - licenses.

The licenses module provides services to document licenses and their terms, and to link those licenses to arbitrary resources on the folio service platform. The actual license metadata is minimal, but mod-licenses then provides a user-extensible set of custom properties where librarians can define and document the terms of their license in a machine readable way. This readme is split into two sections: The first gives information for developers wanting to use the services that mod-licenses exposes to the FOLIO LSP. The latter sections are intended for developers looking to maintain and extend mod-licenses.
